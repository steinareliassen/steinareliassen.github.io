    TrunkFiends is a "friends management interface".
</p>
<p>
    It lets you keep a history of your connection to people you follow and who follow you.
    By scanning your followers / following lists, and comparing it to how it was at previous scan,
    you can keep track of who friended you at what point in time, when they unfollowed you, when you unfollowed them,
    etc.

    This page will be the main info page for Trunkfriends. For now, it will only contain the weekly update / changelog,
    a simple usage manual and install files.
