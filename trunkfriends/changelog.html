Week 45:

<ul>
    <li>
        Release packages has been built for windows and linux. Click on OS to get to the info on where to obtain
        and how to install the packages
    </li>
    <li>
        A few bugs have been fixed, it is now not possible to select a server instance when importing followers.
        In the history view, when zooming in on a user and not being on the first page in a multi page history view,
        the application crashed. This is now fixed, and zoom should work properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        As this application was written in quite a rushed fashion, while at the same time trying to understand
        how things are supposed to be done in Jetpack Compose (the UI framework used), the application suffers
        from overly messy code. Some tidy up have been done, but lots remains, focus was on making the code for
        history overview a bit more tidy. Tidy code = less likely to be buggy!
    </li>
</ul>
