        Download and run <a href="https://github.com/steinareliassen/trunkfriends/releases/download/0.3msi/Trunkfriends-0.3.0.msi">
        Trunkfriends-0.3.0.msi</a>. The installation should be pretty straight forward, and Trunkfriends should be on
        the start menu.

        Do not worry about uninstalling Trunkfriends to install a new version, your data is not removed. The data
        will be in your user home folder, under a folder called .trunkfriends, and it can be a good idea to keep
        a backup of this folder if you want to make sure not to lose data.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you already run Trunkfriends from source, the data is stored in the same location, just install and keep
        using. If there are any issues at all, do not hesitate to send a private message to
        <a href="https://mastodon.social/@trunkfriends">mastodon.social/@trunkfriends</a>!
