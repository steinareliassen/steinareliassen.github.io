                                A number of new features have been merged to main branch. If you have cloned Trunkfriends from git
                                and run it from there, you can pull and get the features directly. If you run it from a downloaded
                                zip file, you can simply replace it with a newly downloaded zip file.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Install file for Windows / Debian (and flavours like Ubuntu) will be packaged shortly.
                                As an alternative to install files, JAR archives will be provided, offering the possibility
                                to run Trunkfriends easily without installing anything, as long as you have Java installed.
                                This will most likely give a way to run Trunkfriends on OSX without needing to run from source.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Some new features, like unfollow / follow accounts and add accounts to list, require a
                                read/write/follow token, while tokens until now have been pure read tokens. If you want to
                                use this functionality, you must obtain a new token. Select the server first, and click the
                                menu button and select "obtain new token".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You get a new view where following / follower accounts are listed, not grouped by
                                when they follow / unfollow like the history overview, but each account appearing only
                                once in the list. This list can be sorted and searched, a handy overview for instance to
                                find all follower on a given domain. Just like in history view, you can zoom in on
                                one account and see all follow / unfollow events for this account, and you can click a
                                checkbox to add it to a "bad", and from there copy the accounts you have selected onto
                                clipboard
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You get a manage follower view, where you can unfollow / follow accounts, and add accounts
                                to a given list. You can either enter accounts manually in the text field and apply
                                action to them, paste from clipboard, or simply insert selected accounts from the "bag"
                                If you have one account on an instance where you have lost people you follow due to
                                defederation, and another one where you want to follow them, simply go to the first
                                account, select the addresses you want to follow, and switch to the other account,
                                go to "manage followers", and click "insert from bag" and then "follow selected"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Manage Follower view indicates the direction I want to take Trunkfriends. While
                                the ability to see if you have lost friends as a result of defederation has been
                                the reason Trunkfriends was made, it would be nice if the app had some more useful
                                aspects that were not quite so depressive. In coming releases, I will add functionality
                                to help you manage your followers, your lists, your blocks, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A gentle reminder though, Trunkfriends is still regarded to be alpha state. This means
                                the testing and quality is not deemed "production ready". If you do not feel comfortable
                                with Trunkfriends having write / follow access to your account, do not obtain new token,
                                the old one will work fine as long as you don't use the "manage account" functions. Take care
                                using the "manage account" functions, look over what Trunkfriends tells you it will do.
                                The functionality has been tested through several times, but issues may still exist.

                                A few bugs have been fixed, it is now not possible to select a server instance when importing followers.
                                In the history view, when zooming in on a user and not being on the first page in a multipage history view,
                                the application crashed. This is now fixed, and zoom should work properly.

                            <li>
                                As this application was written in quite a rushed fashion, while at the same time trying to understand
                                how things are supposed to be done in Jetpack Compose (the UI framework used), the application suffers
                                from overly messy code. Some tidy up have been done, but lots remains, focus was on making the code for
                                history overview a bit more tidy. Tidy code = less likely to be buggy!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Next on the menu is:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The ability to select one or more usernames, and copy these onto the clipboard. This way,
                                        you can take them to the mastodon UI and paste them into follow them. Handy if you have migrated
                                        and want to reconnect with lost connections.</li>
                                    <li>This is the first step towards the next goal of Trunkfriends, managing your followers and lists
                                        more easily than you can in the UI. This is also on the menu, but a bit further up.</li>
