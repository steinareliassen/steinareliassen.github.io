        Release packages has been built for <a href="install_win.html">windows</a> and linux. Click on OS to get
        to the info on where to obtain and how to install the packages
    </li>
    <li>
        A few bugs have been fixed, it is now not possible to select a server instance when importing followers.
        In the history view, when zooming in on a user and not being on the first page in a multipage history view,
        the application crashed. This is now fixed, and zoom should work properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        As this application was written in quite a rushed fashion, while at the same time trying to understand
        how things are supposed to be done in Jetpack Compose (the UI framework used), the application suffers
        from overly messy code. Some tidy up have been done, but lots remains, focus was on making the code for
        history overview a bit more tidy. Tidy code = less likely to be buggy!
    </li>

        Next on the menu is:
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to select one or more usernames, and copy these onto the clipboard. This way,
            you can take them to the mastodon UI and paste them into follow them. Handy if you have migrated
            and want to reconnect with lost connections.</li>
            <li>This is the first step towards the next goal of Trunkfriends, managing your followers and lists
            more easily than you can in the UI. This is also on the menu, but a bit further up.</li>
            <li>More code cleanup.</li>
            <li>Tooltip</li>
